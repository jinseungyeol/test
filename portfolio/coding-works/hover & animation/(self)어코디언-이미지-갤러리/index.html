          <h2>Pomeranian</h2>
          <p>
            Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful. They can be aggressive with other dogs and humans to try to prove themselves.[9][10] Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation.
