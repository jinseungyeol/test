          <h1>Levitating</h1>
          <h3>Dua Lipa</h3>
          <b>Released 1 October 2020</b>
          <p>
            "Levitating" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her second studio album, Future Nostalgia. The song was written by Lipa, Clarence Coffee Jr., Sarah Hudson and Stephen Kozmeniuk, with the image of Mike Myers in Austin Powers in mind. The production was handled by Koz and Stuart Price, and stemmed from a Roland VP-330 synthesizer sample played by the former. The song is an electro-disco and nu-disco song with several disco tropes. It incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop-funk, power pop and space rock, as well as 1970s, 1980s and 1990s pop and R&B styles. The lyrics describe the idea of "levitating" when falling in love, with several outer space references.
