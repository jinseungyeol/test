      <h1>Various Animals From All Over The World.</h1>
      <p>
        <span>A zoo is a facility in which animals</span> are housed within enclosures, cared for, displayed to the public, and in some cases bred for conservation purposes.The term zoological garden refers to zoology, the study of animals. The term is derived from the Greek, zoon, 'animal', and the suffix -logia, 'study of'. The abbreviation zoo was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1847. In the United States alone, <span>zoos are visited by over 181 million people annually.</span>
        <br><br>
        The London Zoo, which was opened in 1828, was initially known as the "Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London", and it described itself as a menagerie or <span>"zoological forest"</span>. The abbreviation "zoo" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the Clifton Zoo, but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the song "Walking in the Zoo" by music-hall artist Alfred Vance.
