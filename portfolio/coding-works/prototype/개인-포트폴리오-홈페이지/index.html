              <span>Henri Matisse (31 December 1869 – 3 November 1954) was a French artist, known for both his use of
                colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but
                is known primarily as a painter. Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso, as one of the
                artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the
                opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and
                sculpture.</span>

              <h2>Odalisque Drawing</h2>
              <em>In the history of art, Matisse is commonly known as “the magician of color,” but one cannot simply
                overlook his sketches and drawings. Henri Matisse is indeed one of the most significant artists in
                modern art history, and his artistic techniques are rooted in the powerful but elegant lines that can be
                easily identified in the artist's nude drawings. Odalisque, a chambermaid in Turkish seraglio or a slave
                in a harem, was one of the major themes for Orientalism in the early 19th century, often seen in the
                nude artworks of various artists, including Ingres, Delacroix, and Renoir. While residing in southern
                France in the early 1920s, Matisse continued to show interest in the exotic Odalisque paintings. He
                created alluring images modeled after a woman dressed in clothing from the East or ladies of the harem
                he met in Morocco. The artist successfully demonstrated the juxtaposition of intense colors and forms by
                portraying figures in captivating ways with the ornamental background.</em>

              <h2>JAZZ and Cut-out</h2>
              <em>When it became difcult to work long hours sitting in front of the easel, Matisse began paper
                “cut-outs” while in bed or sitting in his armchair in 1941, with the help of his assistants. Among his
                cut-outs, the circus-themed (Jazz) series from 1947 is considered the culmination of the technique. The
                book was published by Tériade in a limited edition of 250, and one of the original print is available on
                view in this special exhibition.
                Although the subject matter of the book was circus and plays, it was titled “Jazz” for its variability
                in content. The configurations of these cut-outs were set in stone only after they were attached with
                pins and moved around several times until they were in just the right position, like puzzle pieces. Then
                the composition was stenciled and published into a printed book. Matisse afrmed that he was able to
                achieve a much higher degree of perfection with the cut-outs in the last decade of his life than he did
                with his paintings or sculptures.</em>

              <h2>Matisse's Illustration of Romantic Poetry</h2>
              <em>From 1941 to 1944, Matisse dedicated his time and energy to illustrations for books of poetries
                written by French Romantic and Surrealist poets like Aragon, Mallarmé, and Baudelaire. In 1932, Matisse
                unveiled 29 etchings as illustrations for Mallarmé’s Poesies. The illustrations display an exquisite
                balance between Matisse’s delicate and simple lines and the naivety and sentimentality in the poems of
                Mallarmé. After this work, Matisse also produced illustrations for many poetries including Baudelaire’s
                Les Fleurs du Mal (1947). While the illustrations of Matisse do consociate to poems, they also have
                independent signiﬁcance as art. Since drawings are expressions of concise and quick lines rather than
                being descriptions of the poem itself, it invites the viewers to analyze and envisage even more. Hence,
                Matisse’s illustrated copies of French Romantic poems are still acknowledged and accepted as
                artworks.</em>
