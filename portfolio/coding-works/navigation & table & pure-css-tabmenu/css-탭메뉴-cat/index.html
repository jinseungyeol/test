            <h2>Russian Blue</h2>
            <p>
              The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that may have originated in the port of Arkhangelsk in Russia.[1] They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues.[2] It is believed that sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s.[1] The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat. The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912, when it was given its own class. The breed was developed mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World War II.

            <h2>Bengal Cat</h2>
            <p>
              The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau, with the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). The breed name comes from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their leopard cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are an energetic breed which needs much exercise and play.The earliest mention of an Asian leopard cat × domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote of them in Our Cats and All About Them.

            <h2>Munchkin cat</h2>
            <p>
              The Munchkin cat or Sausage cat is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by genetic mutation. The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues. Many pedigree cat associations around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and severity of the health issues, including the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF).
